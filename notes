Database architecture
---------------------

recipes: IxSet Recipe (including ingredients, servings and size (WxH or disc(D)))
products: IxSet Product {
  general name,
  provides ingredient,
  price observations [(shop, price)] }

Should we need to store the recipe set in the db context - otherwise won't it
be loaded afresh every time?

Interface
---------

Goals
~~~~~

Input data from a receipt with minimal effort
Filter by category
Sort by rating and perhaps other fields
Show/sort by entry time/seq

Approach
~~~~~~~~

Allow scaling ingredients by an arbitrary factor as well as relative to serves or size
