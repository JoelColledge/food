Database architecture
---------------------

recipes: IxSet Recipe (including ingredients, servings and size (WxH or disc(D)))
products: IxSet Product {
  general name,
  provides ingredient,
  price observations [(shop, price)] }

Should we need to store the recipe set in the db context - otherwise won't it
be loaded afresh every time?

Interface
---------

Goals
~~~~~

Input data from a receipt with minimal effort
y Filter by category
y Sort by rating and perhaps other fields
Show/sort by entry time/seq

Approach
~~~~~~~~

Allow scaling ingredients by an arbitrary factor as well as relative to serves or size

TODO
----

Replace ID with type that allows dates too

= Allow creation of new categories
=   e.g. http://www.tutorialrepublic.com/twitter-bootstrap-tutorial/bootstrap-typeahead.php
Suggest book names similarly

- Release

Database auto-backup and archive

Allow sorting by generic sequence

New typeahead suggestions aren't fetched

Split Recipes.hs into Recipes and RecipeEditor

Rename multi-text-double because it now has an extra text field

Drop-down for source selection (including null), only show required fields
Show the sequence val somewhere

Show and allow editing of general properties

Prices from supermarkets
