Database architecture
---------------------

recipes: IxSet Recipe (including ingredients, servings and size (WxH or disc(D)))
products: IxSet Product {
  general name,
  provides ingredient,
  price observations [(shop, price)] }

Should we need to store the recipe set in the db context - otherwise won't it
be loaded afresh every time?

Interface
---------

Goals
~~~~~

Input data from a receipt with minimal effort
y Filter by category
y Sort by rating and perhaps other fields
Show/sort by entry time/seq

Approach
~~~~~~~~

Allow scaling ingredients by an arbitrary factor as well as relative to serves or size

TODO
----

Split Recipes.hs into Recipes and RecipeEditor

Rename multi-text-double because it now has an extra text field

Drop-down for source selection (including null), only show required fields
Replace ID with type that allows dates too
Allow sorting by this generic sequence
Show the sequence val somewhere

Allow creation of new categories
  e.g. http://www.tutorialrepublic.com/twitter-bootstrap-tutorial/bootstrap-typeahead.php
Suggest book names similarly

Show and allow editing of general properties

Prices
